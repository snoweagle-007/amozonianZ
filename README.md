This work aims at bootstrapping the acoustic model training with small amount of the human annotated speech data and large amount of the unlabelled speech data for automatic speech recognition.The technologies of the semi-supervised learning were investigated to select the automatically transcribed training samples.Two semi-supervised learning methods were proposed: one is the local-global uncertainty based method which introduces both the local uncertainty from the current utterance, and the global uncertainty from the whole data pool into the data selection; the other is the margin based data selection, which selects the utterances near to the decision boundary through the language model tuning. The experimental results based on a Japanese far-field automatic speech recognition system indicated that the acoustic model trained by the automatically transcribed speech data achieved about 17% relative gain when the in-domain human annotated data was not available for initialization. While 3.7% relative gain was obtained when the initial acoustic model was trained by small amount of the in-domain data. Index Term are initialized under the relative gain of 5.7% or higher is expected. 

**Needed conditional regeneration operation for the Clark Team expecting the results by 21-09-2023 by EOD IST**
**Codes have been updated by SumedKhan/ClarkDevTeam/ joined submission with JaruVineeth/ClarkDevTeam/ means that it can be operated from AWS.**


Description :
// This is a sample Debt calculator application that calculates the loan based on the families expenses.  **USING DJAKSTRA ALGORITHM, IT CALCULATES THE ESTIMATED DURATION TO COMPLETE THE LOAN OR DEBT **KINDLY note that this project is SECURED UNDER GNU VERSION LICENSE 3.O OR HIGHER. COPYRIGHTS ARE NOT STRICTLY ENCOURAGED.**
 **Yes, this is a basic application, yet, it took more than 3 hours for US to code it and make it running.**

Working:

Takes the user input as montly expenses, income and rents etc..
Calculates the loan or debt amount that has to be payed from the savings automatically. 
**DJAKISTRA APPROACH is used, expecting small TLE Errors too -- added by Vaibhav.S**
**Enhancement of UI is still being under consideration.**

TODO :
**UI ENHANCEMENT**
**MORE OPTIONS**
